 Hi I am capy. So this is the solution of the Blog preview card challange.  I used a little bit of self written css and remaining using bootstrap 5. It is really helpful.


 Q.What I am most proud of and what wiil I do different next time?
 ->  Its been like months since I have worked with html and css and was kind of like forgetting how i do it so after doing challenges i felt confident .
 -> I will write css entirly myself.

 Q. What challenges did I encountered and how did I overcome them?
 -> When i was styling the card I was not able  to give the card a reponsive width and giving p element proper css property fpr styling (because of live server not working properly). The  font assestes provided by FEM i was not able to use them because in my system looks perfect so I only used it once for making h3 extra bold.
 -> SO about the responsiveness there are many ways to do it but i remeber coding2go video in which he used clamp value to make a card responsive so i tried myslef but was not able to so I consulted chatgpt and then I was able to make the card responsive. and justrestarted the browser and the live server started working perfectly.


 Q. What specific area of my project will i like help with?
 -> I am dumb so i cant properly names div and some times i misplace things so i will love if someone reviews my code and contacts me to help with it.
